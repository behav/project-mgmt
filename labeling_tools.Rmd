# Potential Labelers

The labeler **needs** to have the following attributes:

- Ability to handle both images and video

- Import/export annotations

- Some sort of layered annotations for comparisons

The labeler will **preferably** have the following:

- Import/export multiple types of annotations (e.g., `.csv`,`.json`)

- Add meta-data

## [Microsoft Visual Object Tagging Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT)
Visual Object Tagging Tool: An electron app for building end to end Object
Detection Models from Images and Videos.

- Can run locally or in a web app

  - Web app cannot access local file system
  
  - webapp [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jcjimenez/vott-web/)
  
- No way to import external data

## [Labelbox](https://github.com/Labelbox/Labelbox)
Labelbox is the fastest way to annotate data to build and ship computer vision applications.

- Written in javascript

- Easily create custom interfaces

- Video analysis seems to be proprietary (https://www.labelbox.com/pricing)

## [UltimateLabeling](https://github.com/alexandre01/UltimateLabeling)
A multi-purpose Video Labeling GUI in Python with integrated SOTA detector and tracker.

- Ability to import pre-existing files

    Import labels: To import existing .CSV labels, hit Cmd+I (or Ctrl+I).
    UltimateLabeling expects to read one .CSV file per frame, 
    in the format: "class_id", "xc", "yc", "w", "h".
    
- `csv` file import/export

- Can connect to remote server via `ssh`

- YOLO integration

- Seems to be under active development (i.e., missing some features)

## [cvat](https://github.com/opencv/cvat)
Powerful and efficient Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT)

- `XML` file output

- Can only be run in Google Chrome

- Run via docker compose (i.e., multiple containers), which is incompatible with
singularity (as far as I know)

## [ViPER](http://viper-toolkit.sourceforge.net/)

- Written in Java (cross platform)

- Loads annotations via `XML`

- Relatively old (2015)

## [Anvil](https://www.anvil-software.org/)

- Written in Java

- Relatively old (2015)
  
## [sloth](https://github.com/cvhciKIT/sloth)
Sloth is a tool for labeling image and video data for computer vision research.
